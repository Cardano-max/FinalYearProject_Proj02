House Map Designer App is a new concept in interior design. This application helps users to create their own home map according to their taste with the help of various furniture items.  The basic idea was to make use of this app for decoration purpose and also it can be used by interior designers for providing quick services to their clients. Users can apply colors to the rooms, change the orientation of the room, select different furniture items for each room, save maps and view them later.  This app is completely based on the Google maps technology that helps users locate all the rooms on maps without any hassle. There are different modes of maps available for users like floor plan, 3D View, 2D View and satellite view. Maps can be saved as BMP image files or PDF files so that people can easily refer back to them. Users can also share these plans with others through SMS or email.
